# I wear many hats

---

# Rust language designer

???

Longest surviving member of Rust team

---

# Senior Principal Engineer @ Amazon 

???

Amazon is adopting Rust for many purposes

I lead Amazon's efforts to invest in Rust and support the Rust language.

I'll talk more about this.

---

# What hat am I wearing today?

All of them.

None of them.

???

I'm here giving you my personal opinion.
I won't tell you that I wear no hats.
I don't believe a person can truly take off a hat.
I don't believe you would want them to.
I'm influenced by what Amazon needs.
I'm influenced by what people at Mozilla needed.
And I'm influenced most of all by what I see that *Rust* needs.
I'll talk more about this as I go.

What I do want to be clear on, though, is that I'm going to talk about some proposals and design directions. For the most part these represent my desires and not the consensus of the Rust language design team. 

I'll be clear about it.

# Rust in 2024

What I see...

* GREAT OPPORTUNITY
* ~~GREAT RISK~~ SOME RISK

???

- Cut to the chase
    - What do I see for Rust?
        - I see *opportunity*
        - I also see *risk*
        - **Stability without stagnation** has never been more important
        - I'm here to talk about what I see working great, and what I see as big priorities to improve

# Our North Star

### Empowering everyone to build reliable, efficient, and maintainable software

--

*Design for the long term*

???

As always, Rust's north star remains empowerment 

---

# Rust's most important value?

### RELIABILITY?

--

### PERFORMANCE?

--

### ACCESSIBILITY?

---

# Rust's most important value?

--

### STABILITY *without* STAGNATION

???

These days I tend to think of *Stability without stagnation* as our ur-value.
Rust can never be perfect. 
We'll never get everything right the first time.
But as long as we persist in growing changing and innovating, we are going to be ok.
